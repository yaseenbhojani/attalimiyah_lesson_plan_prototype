Lesson Plan ERP Guidelines Version 2
7th November, 2025 

This document represents Version 2 of the Lesson Plan Guidelines for the ERP Module, revised following the meeting with Taher BS on October 25, 2025. It outlines the updated module requirements discussed as a continuation of the previous document.
1.Lesson Allocation and Timetable
Each lesson must be linked to the official school timetable and lesson allocation plan. The lesson plan should align with the Lesson Allocation Policy.
Teachers must prepare and submit their lesson plans to the Head of Section (HoS) for review and approval. 
1.1.System Reporting (Dashboard View):
The ERP system should generate automated reports showing:
Timely submission of lesson plans.
Timely review and approval of lesson plans by the HoS.
Count of:
oLesson plans submitted
oLesson plans approved
oLesson plans overdue
1.2.Lesson Plan Sharing:
The system should have an option of sharing the Lesson plans. Only panel-approved lesson plans will be available for sharing within the ERP. 
2.Curriculum  
The curriculum includes grades, subjects, themes, topics, Student Learning Outcomes (SLOs) and suggested pedagogical techniques. 
A Master of curriculum will be developed and shared with the ERP team. Linear plans pdf files to be shared with the ERP team. 
The ERP system should track the status of SLOs—showing which have been achieved and which remain pending. 
Cognitive domain SLOs will be derived from the curriculum document.
Affective and psychomotor domain SLOs will be written by teachers and selected from a drop-down menu.
3.Cross-Curricular Integration
The ERP system should allow tagging and linking of lessons across subjects for cross-curricular integration.
4.Resources for Lesson Plan 
The ERP should include a comprehensive Master Resource List comprising three categories:
4.1.Textbook Resources:
oMaster list of current textbooks for each subject and grade, including student books and teacher reference books.
oA structured table of all curriculum-related books and resources.
4.2.Library Resources:
oLibrary books and digital materials relevant to subjects and topics.
4.3.Supplementary Resources:
oWorksheets, presentations, videos, and other teaching materials.
The following outlines the workflow for managing lesson plan resources.
Step 1: Creation of Master Resource List
The ERP Admin Department creates and maintains a Master Resource List within the system.
The list is organized into three main categories: Textbook Resources, Library Resources, and Supplementary Resources.
Step 2: Categorization of Resources
1. Textbook Resources
A detailed table is created listing all current textbooks for each subject and grade level.
Each entry includes:
oGrade 
oSubject 
oBook title
oAuthor/publisher details
oEdition/year
oType: Student Book or Teacher Reference Book
oCurriculum alignment (linking each book to specific curriculum like Integrated, Cambridge etc.).
2. Library Resources
The system integrates a database of library books and digital materials aligned with subjects and topics.
Each resource includes:
oBook title or digital resource name
oSubject/topic relevance
oResource format (print, e-book, video, etc.)
oAccess location (library shelf, ERP digital repository, etc.)
3. Supplementary Resources
A repository of worksheets, presentations, videos, and teaching aids is uploaded and tagged by subject, grade, and topic.
Each item includes:
oResource type (worksheet, PPT, video, etc.)
oDescription and learning objective
oUpload link or file access path
Step 3: Resource Linking in Lesson Plan
When teachers create a Lesson Plan, the ERP allows them to select relevant resources directly from the Master Resource List.
Teachers can:
oAdd or suggest additional resources (subject to approval by the Academic Department).
oFilter resources by grade, subject, or topic for easy selection.
Step 4: Review and Approval
Academic Coordinators or Heads of Section review and approve added or suggested resources before they appear in the shared library.
Approved resources are then automatically updated in the Master Resource List.
Step 5: Continuous Update
The ERP system periodically prompts updates to the Master Resource List.
New textbooks, digital resources, or supplementary materials can be added through version-controlled updates.
5.Pre-Lesson Preparation
Teachers must complete all pre-lesson tasks and gather required materials and resources.
The system should allow teachers to generate requisitions for materials and resources via a text box input.
Instructional Sequence
This part of the lesson plan mainly focuses teaching and learning in the class which includes three parts:
1.Anticipation: 
This section includes: 1) a hook activity and 2) recap prompts. The teacher will describe how the hook activity will be conducted and how the recap of the previous topic will take place. 
It should include two textboxes where teacher can write description of how he/she will conduct the hook or recap. It should include a feature that allows the uploading and storage of various content types—such as text, links, videos, images, Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, and PDF files. 
2.Building Knowledge: 
This section represents the core part of the lesson, where the teacher introduces and develops new concepts through various teaching methods and learning activities. In this section, teacher explains how the topic will be taught, outlining the instructional approach and key steps. This part includes a main activity for teaching the topic. 
The activity should include the following features: 
2.1.Name of the Main Activity
Specify the title of the main activity used to teach the topic — for example, presentation, interactive discussion, question–answer, think pair share, group discussion, showing video or any other method suitable for explaining the topic.
2.2.Description of the Activity
Provide a brief description of how the activity will be conducted — such as explaining the key concepts through PPT, showing video and explaining the concept, organizing group work or group to teach the topic.
2.3.Resources Box 
List or attach the resources used during the main activity, including PowerPoint presentations, images, PDFs, video links that support the activity and help explain the topic.

2.3 Resources Box	Teachers attach or list instructional materials used during the activity.	Upload or link relevant files (PPTs, images, PDFs, videos). - Option to select existing resources from the Master Resource List (Textbook, Library, Supplementary). System automatically links resources to the specific lesson and topic.	Promotes resource organization, reusability, and quality assurance.

The following guidelines are part of the previous ERP document for Lesson Plan shared on 27th August, 2025. 
Resource Pool with Drag-and-Drop:
oDevelop a Resource Library (e.g., database of activities, videos, assessments).
oAllow teachers to search, preview, and drag resources into the lesson plan sections.
The system should include a feature that allows the uploading and storage of various content types—such as text, links, videos, worksheets, images, Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, and PDF files—into the database. Additionally, the system should automatically extract and organize the references for the materials used, and list them under the 'Resources' section. The activity should be recorded in the system and searchable as per grade, subject and topic in the future. 
A Master Activity to be created and shared with the ERP team.
The process for creating an activity should be clearly outlined.
In the future, the system should allow search and retrieval of activities by subject and topic.
3.Consolidation: 
This section outlines the strategy used to conclude the topic, recap key concepts, or assess students’ understanding of the lesson. It should include a text box where the teacher describes the method or activity that will be used to effectively wrap up the lesson.
The Consolidation Section of the lesson plan will consist of three structured boxes under the consolidation section, allowing teachers to plan how each lesson will be concluded:
3.1.Name of the Activity:
Specify the title or type of consolidation activity used to conclude the topic — for example, Question–Answer session, Quick Recap, Exit Ticket, Mini Quiz, Group Reflection, or any other method suitable for reinforcing learning.
